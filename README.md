# Breakout Game

Welcome to the Breakout Game! This game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and must use it to bounce a ball against a wall of bricks at the top of the screen, destroying them and earning points. The game is over when the player loses the ball or destroys all the bricks.
